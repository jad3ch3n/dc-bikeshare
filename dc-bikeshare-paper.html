  <h1>üö≤ Bikeshare Ridership Analysis</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Jade Chen<br>
     <strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üß† Objective</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project is to analyze bikeshare ridership patterns by distinguishing between two key user groups: <strong>casual riders</strong> and <strong>registered riders</strong>. Using real-world data and exploratory visualizations, the analysis investigates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How ridership volume varies across working days vs non-working days</li>
      <li>The correlation between casual and registered usage</li>
      <li>Density distributions to understand rider behavior</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üìä Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>The dataset includes daily ride counts segmented by user type (casual vs registered), as well as temporal and contextual variables such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>workingday</code>: Indicator for workdays</li>
      <li><code>casual</code>, <code>registered</code>, <code>count</code>: Ride counts by user type</li>
      <li><code>season</code>, <code>holiday</code>, and date metadata</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before analysis, the data was cleaned and filtered to enable conditional comparisons and plotting.</p>

    <h2>üìà Methods and Visualizations</h2>

    <h3>1. Scatterplot of Casual vs Registered Riders</h3>
    <p>A scatterplot was used to compare casual and registered ride volumes across the full dataset. A positive but non-linear trend suggests that increased casual use often correlates with increased registered use, though at different scales.</p>

    <h3>2. LOWESS Smoothing</h3>
    <p>Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) was applied to reveal underlying trends in noisy data. This helped isolate the general pattern without assuming a specific model. The temperature relationship with casual ridership was most evident on weekends.</p>

    <h3>3. KDE Density Plot (Working Days Only)</h3>
    <p>Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) visualized the joint distribution of casual and registered riders on working days. Registered riders dominate weekday activity. On weekends, casual ridership becomes more prevalent.</p>

    <h3>4. Overlay KDE Comparison (Workday vs Non-Workday)</h3>
    <p>Stacked KDE plots show how rider dynamics shift: registered ridership dominates on working days while casual ridership peaks on non-working days, particularly Saturdays and Sundays.</p>

    <h3>5. Temperature Effects</h3>
    <p>Visualizations were created to explore how normalized temperature impacts the proportion of casual riders across different weekdays. Warmer temperatures are strongly associated with higher casual ridership.</p>

    <h3>6. Hourly Usage Patterns</h3>
    <p>This line plot compares hourly averages. Registered riders peak during morning and evening commute times. Casual riders are more active midday, especially on weekends.</p>

    <h2>üîç Key Insights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Registered riders</strong> are more consistent on working days, indicating commuting behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Casual riders</strong> spike on weekends and holidays, suggesting recreational use.</li>
      <li>The <strong>LOWESS curve</strong> captures non-linear relationships between user groups.</li>
      <li><strong>KDE plots</strong> offer a more nuanced view than simple scatterplots.</li>
      <li><strong>Temperature</strong> is a key driver of casual ridership, especially on weekends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìÅ Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This bikeshare ridership analysis provides a visual, data-driven lens into how different types of users engage with urban transit systems. These findings could inform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Marketing strategies (e.g., targeting casual riders on weekends)</li>
      <li>Infrastructure planning (e.g., ensuring enough bikes during commuter hours)</li>
      <li>Incentive programs to convert casual users to registered memberships</li>
    </ul>
